Within the Analytics-Programming-with-R domain, I've undertaken a project centered around Fantasy Premier League (FPL), 
delving into the intricacies of this popular online game. 

Through data analysis and programming in R, I've explored strategies, player performance metrics, 
and managerial decisions, unveiling insights to aid FPL managers in optimizing their virtual teams for success.
